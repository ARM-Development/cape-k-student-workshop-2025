Here is the AMS data. Due to problems with the instrument at the start of campaign we started sampling with this one in the first half of Nov.
The data contains time series of the standard AMS species (organics, sulfate, ammonium, nitrate, chloride) + a mass fragment that is used as a proxy for MSA.
