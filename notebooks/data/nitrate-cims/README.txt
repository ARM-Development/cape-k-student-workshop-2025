The first dataset I am sending is sulfuric (SA) , methanesulfonic (MSA) and iodic acid (IA) in gas phase (i.e. species relevant for new particle formation) measured by nitrate-CIMS. The data is given in counts per second (cps)
What stands out are beautiful diurnal profiles for both SA and IA

The data is not QCed and it definitely should not be used beyond this workshop.
